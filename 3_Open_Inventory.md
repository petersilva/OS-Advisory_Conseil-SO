Welcome to the Open Source Project Inventory. We are trying to understand all of the open source projects that are taking place across the Government of Canada. If you are working on a project, please add it to this list. We do not want to be too prescriptive at this point, so we have not created a controlled vocabulary for domain, however, this list will help us work towards that. 

Please submit your project by poll request, an admin will review and approve. Thanks!
